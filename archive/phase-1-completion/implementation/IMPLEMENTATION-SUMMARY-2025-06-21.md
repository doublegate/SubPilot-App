## What's Ready for Week 2

With these implementations, the following Week 2 tasks can now proceed:

1. **Plaid Integration**: Placeholders are ready to be filled with actual Plaid SDK calls
2. **Transaction Sync**: Database schema and endpoints ready for transaction data
3. **Subscription Detection**: Pattern detection algorithm can be implemented
4. **Dashboard Enhancement**: All components ready to display real data

## Testing the Implementation

To verify all implementations are working:

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Check TypeScript
npm run type-check

# Start dev server and test manually
npm run dev
```

## Summary

All critical missing features identified in the documentation have been implemented. The project now has:

- ✅ Complete API layer with all 6 routers
- ✅ Database connected and schema synced
- ✅ Security middleware protecting all routes
- ✅ UI components for all major features
- ✅ Testing infrastructure ready for TDD

The application is now ready for Phase 1, Week 2 development focusing on bank integration and real data flow.
