# Dashboard Fixes Summary

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-26 12:24 AM EDT  
**Version**: v0.1.9

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CSS Container Styling
- **Problem**: Dashboard was crammed to the left side
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper container styles in `globals.css`
  - Updated dashboard layout with responsive padding classes
  - Added `mx-auto px-4 py-6 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` to container

### 2. Subscription Detection Algorithm
- **Problem**: No subscriptions were being detected despite syncing
- **Root Cause**: No transactions in database (sync wasn't importing data)
- **Solutions**:
  - Improved merchant name normalization to be less aggressive
  - Made frequency detection windows more lenient (e.g., monthly: 25-35 days)
  - Enhanced amount consistency calculation with 5% tolerance
  - Added better confidence scoring

### 3. Mock Data System
- **Problem**: No way to test without real bank data
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive mock data generator
  - 15 realistic subscription patterns (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
  - Random one-time transactions for realism
  - Generates 6+ months of transaction history
  - Button on dashboard to generate test data

### 4. UI Improvements
- **Added "Detect Subscriptions" button** for manual detection
- **Added "Generate Test Data" button** for testing
- **Better feedback** with toast notifications
- **Auto-refresh data** after detection
- **Filter to show only active subscriptions** on dashboard

## How to Test

1. Connect a bank account (use Plaid sandbox)
2. Click "Generate Test Data" button
3. Wait for detection to complete automatically
4. Check dashboard stats and subscription list
5. Use "Detect Subscriptions" button to re-run detection

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
- `/src/styles/globals.css` - Added container styles
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Fixed container padding
- `/src/server/services/subscription-detector.ts` - Improved detection algorithm
- `/src/server/api/routers/plaid.ts` - Added mock data generation
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added UI improvements
- `/src/server/services/mock-data.ts` - Created mock data generator

### Key Algorithm Improvements:
- Merchant name normalization preserves more of original name
- Frequency windows expanded (e.g., monthly 27-33 â†’ 25-35 days)
- Amount tolerance added (5% variation allowed)
- Confidence scoring more lenient
- Minimum transactions requirement still 2

## Recent UI Fixes (2025-06-26)

### Theme System Consistency
- **Fixed**: Input fields on Profile page not following dark/light theme
- **Fixed**: Input fields on Settings/Billing page not following theme
- **Solution**: Added proper dark mode classes to all input components
- **Result**: Complete theme consistency across all forms

### Analytics Calendar Improvements
- **Fixed**: Calendar date overflow with long subscription lists
- **Added**: Hover tooltips showing full subscription details
- **Solution**: Truncate display to 2 items with "..." indicator
- **Result**: Clean calendar layout with full information on hover

### UI Polish
- **Fixed**: Removed redundant "Settings" from "Profile Settings" title
- **Result**: Cleaner, more consistent page titles

## Next Steps

1. Test with real Plaid data to ensure it works with actual transactions
2. Fine-tune detection parameters based on real-world data
3. Add more sophisticated merchant categorization
4. Implement subscription management features (pause, cancel)
5. Add spending analytics and insights
6. Consider adding theme transition animations
7. Monitor user feedback on calendar tooltips
