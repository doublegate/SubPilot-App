## Archiving Process

### Documents Moved

From `docs/`:
1. `PHASE-3-COMPLETE.md` → `archive/phase-3-completion/reports/`
2. `PHASE-3-CANCELLATION-IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `archive/phase-3-completion/implementation/`
3. `PHASE-3-PREMIUM-FEATURES-COMPLETE.md` → `archive/phase-3-completion/implementation/`
4. `CANCELLATION_SYSTEM.md` → `archive/phase-3-completion/implementation/`
5. `EVENT_DRIVEN_CANCELLATION.md` → `archive/phase-3-completion/implementation/`
6. `lightweight-cancellation-system.md` → `archive/phase-3-completion/implementation/`
7. `UNIFIED_CANCELLATION_SYSTEM.md` → `archive/phase-3-completion/implementation/`

### Documents Retained

The following documents were kept in their original locations as they remain relevant for ongoing development:

- `to-dos/phase-3-automation.md` - Reference for completed tasks
- Various API integration guides in `docs/` - Still needed for Phase 4
- Component documentation - Active use in development
