# Phase 3 Week 1: Cancellation Integration Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of SubPilot's cancellation system, which enables users to cancel their subscriptions through multiple methods: API integration, web automation, and manual guidance.

## Database Schema Updates

### New Models Added

1. **CancellationProvider**
   - Stores provider configurations for different cancellation methods
   - Includes API endpoints, web automation scripts, and manual instructions
   - Tracks success rates and average cancellation times

2. **CancellationRequest**
   - Tracks individual cancellation attempts
   - Records status, method used, confirmation codes, and errors
   - Supports retry logic with exponential backoff

3. **CancellationLog**
   - Audit trail for all cancellation activities
   - Records each step of the cancellation process

## Backend Implementation

### Core Services

1. **CancellationService** (`src/server/services/cancellation.service.ts`)
   - Main orchestrator for cancellation requests
   - Handles method selection, retry logic, and status tracking
   - Methods:
     - `initiateCancellation()`: Start a new cancellation
     - `processCancellation()`: Execute the cancellation
     - `getCancellationStatus()`: Check request status
     - `retryCancellation()`: Retry failed attempts
     - `confirmManualCancellation()`: Confirm manual cancellations
     - `getCancellationHistory()`: View past cancellations

2. **Provider Implementations**
   - **ApiCancellationProvider**: Direct API integrations
   - **WebAutomationProvider**: Playwright-based automation
   - **ManualCancellationProvider**: Step-by-step instructions

3. **AutomationService** (`src/server/services/automation.service.ts`)
   - Wrapper around Playwright for web automation
   - Handles browser control, navigation, and screenshots
   - Includes anti-detection measures and 2FA support

### Provider-Specific Implementations

Mock implementations created for:

- Netflix (`implementations/netflix.ts`)
- Spotify (`implementations/spotify.ts`)
- Adobe (`implementations/adobe.ts`)
- Amazon Prime (`implementations/amazon.ts`)
- Apple Music (`implementations/apple.ts`)

Each provider includes realistic scenarios for:

- Successful cancellations
- Authentication failures
- Retention offers
- Refund processing

### tRPC API Routes

New router: `src/server/api/routers/cancellation.ts`

Endpoints:

- `cancellation.initiate`: Start cancellation process
- `cancellation.status`: Check cancellation status
- `cancellation.retry`: Retry failed cancellation
- `cancellation.confirmManual`: Confirm manual cancellation
- `cancellation.history`: Get cancellation history
- `cancellation.availableMethods`: Check available methods for a subscription
- `cancellation.providerInfo`: Get provider details
- `cancellation.analytics`: Get cancellation analytics

## Frontend Components

### New UI Components

1. **CancelSubscriptionButton** (`src/components/cancellation/cancel-subscription-button.tsx`)
   - Primary interface for initiating cancellations
   - Handles quick cancellations for easy providers
   - Shows confirmation dialog for destructive action

2. **CancellationModal** (`src/components/cancellation/cancellation-modal.tsx`)
   - Main modal for cancellation method selection
   - Displays provider information and difficulty
   - Shows estimated time and special requirements

3. **CancellationStatus** (`src/components/cancellation/cancellation-status.tsx`)
   - Real-time status tracking with polling
   - Shows confirmation codes and effective dates
   - Handles retry for failed attempts

4. **ManualInstructionsDialog** (`src/components/cancellation/manual-instructions-dialog.tsx`)
   - Step-by-step guide for manual cancellations
   - Progress tracking through steps
   - Contact information display
   - Confirmation form for completed cancellations

5. **SubscriptionActionsEnhanced** (`src/components/subscription-actions-enhanced.tsx`)
   - Enhanced actions dropdown with cancellation history
   - Integrates cancellation button with existing actions

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Method Cancellation

- **API Integration**: Direct cancellation through provider APIs
- **Web Automation**: Automated browser control for providers without APIs
- **Manual Guidance**: Step-by-step instructions when automation isn't possible

### 2. Smart Method Selection

- Automatically determines best cancellation method
- Prioritizes API > Web Automation > Manual
- Falls back gracefully when methods fail

### 3. Comprehensive Tracking

- Real-time status updates
- Confirmation code storage
- Effective date tracking
- Refund amount recording

### 4. Retry Logic

- Exponential backoff for failed attempts
- Maximum retry limits
- Error categorization for better handling

### 5. Manual Confirmation Flow

- Users can confirm manual cancellations
- Captures confirmation codes and notes
- Updates subscription status appropriately

### 6. Provider Intelligence

- Difficulty ratings (easy/medium/hard)
- Average time estimates
- Special requirements (2FA, retention offers)
- Contact information

## Security Considerations

1. **Encrypted Storage**: Access tokens and credentials encrypted
2. **Audit Logging**: All cancellation attempts logged
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of automation features
4. **Session Tracking**: IP and user agent recording
5. **Error Handling**: Sensitive information never exposed in errors

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Comprehensive test suite for CancellationService
- Mock implementations for all external dependencies
- Coverage for success and failure scenarios

### Integration Points

- tRPC router integration with existing API
- Database migrations for new models
- UI component integration with subscription cards

## Database Seeding

Created seed script: `prisma/seed-cancellation-providers.ts`

Includes configurations for:

- Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, Hulu
- Adobe Creative Cloud
- Amazon Prime, Apple Music
- YouTube Premium

Run with: `npm run db:seed:cancellation`

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3 Week 2-3 Priorities

1. **Real Provider Integrations**
   - Replace mock implementations with actual API calls
   - Implement OAuth flows for provider authentication
   - Add webhook support for async confirmations

2. **Enhanced Automation**
   - CAPTCHA solving integration
   - Advanced 2FA handling
   - Headless browser optimization

3. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Success rate tracking by provider
   - Average cancellation times
   - Common failure reasons

4. **User Experience**
   - Bulk cancellation support
   - Scheduled cancellations
   - Cancellation reminders

## Usage

### For Users

1. Click "Cancel" button on any subscription
2. Choose cancellation method (if multiple available)
3. Follow automated process or manual instructions
4. Confirm cancellation when complete

### For Developers

1. Run database migrations to add new tables
2. Seed cancellation providers: `npm run db:seed:cancellation`
3. Implement real provider APIs as needed
4. Extend provider configurations for new services

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: tRPC, Prisma, Playwright
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library

## Conclusion

The cancellation system provides a robust foundation for helping users regain control over their subscriptions. With support for multiple cancellation methods and comprehensive tracking, SubPilot can handle various provider requirements while maintaining a smooth user experience.
