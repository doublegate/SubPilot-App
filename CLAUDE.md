- **Accent**: Purple (#9333EA) - Premium and modern
- **Typography**: Inter font family

### UI Components

Using shadcn/ui component library with custom Tailwind theme. Components should follow the established design tokens in `css_theme/`.

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer server components by default
- Use tRPC for all API endpoints
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Git Workflow

- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description`
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Maintain good test coverage
- **TypeScript Compilation Excellence**: All mock data must match current Prisma schema, resolve UMD globals with proper imports, fix null assignments with type guards

**Previous**: v1.8.5 Critical Security Fixes & OAuth Authentication Improvements
**Focus**: Phase 4 (Launch & Marketing) - Production-ready with enterprise authentication
**Archive**: Historical phase details available in `/archive/phase-*-completion/`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Database First**: The Prisma schema is comprehensive and ready. Use it as the source of truth for data models.

2. **Type Safety**: Leverage tRPC and TypeScript for end-to-end type safety. The types should flow from database → API → frontend.

3. **Server Components**: Default to server components. Only use client components for interactivity.

4. **Security**: All sensitive data (Plaid tokens, etc.) must be encrypted. Never expose API keys in client code.

5. **Testing**: Write tests as you implement features. Don't leave testing until the end.

6. **Edge Runtime Compatibility**: Middleware runs in Edge Runtime. Use `auth-edge.ts` for auth checks instead of importing the full auth config. Complex security features (rate limiting, audit logging) must be in API routes, not middleware.

7. **Docker Health Checks**: Use DOCKER_HEALTH_CHECK_MODE=basic for test environments to skip database checks.

8. **ESLint v9 Migration**: Project uses flat config format with `eslint.config.js`. Install `@eslint/eslintrc` for compatibility with legacy extends. Remove old `.eslintrc.cjs` files. Migration completed 2025-07-04 01:52 EDT with working configuration.

9. **ESLint Error Fixing**: Use systematic six-agent approach to fix TypeScript type safety issues. NEVER remove features - implement proper types instead. Focus on unsafe any assignments, missing interfaces, and nullish coalescing adoption.

8. **CI/CD Best Practices**: Prefer single comprehensive workflows over multiple specialized ones for easier maintenance.


## 📞 External Services

## 🧪 Test Data Best Practices

When writing tests with TypeScript, define individual typed constants instead of using array access:

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid - TypeScript can't guarantee array element exists
const mockAccounts = [...];
const account = mockAccounts[0]; // Type: Account | undefined

// ✅ Preferred - TypeScript knows these constants exist
const mockAccount1: Account = {...};
const mockAccount2: Account = {...};
const mockAccounts: Account[] = [mockAccount1, mockAccount2];
const account = mockAccount1; // Type: Account (guaranteed)
```

This pattern eliminates the need for non-null assertions and improves test maintainability.

### TypeScript Compilation Excellence
- All mock data must match current Prisma schema
- Add missing imports (React, types) to resolve UMD globals
- Null assignment issues resolved with proper type guards
- Aggregate mock results align with expected Prisma types
- ESLint Config: Test files need rule overrides for flexible typing
- TypeScript Fixes: Use 'as any' sparingly for test mock compatibility

## 🔐 Security Testing Patterns

  - Session Management: 33 tests for fingerprinting and concurrent sessions
  - Rate Limiting: 23 tests for multi-tier limits with premium benefits
  - Audit Logging: 26 tests for security event tracking
- **Key Patterns**:
  - Test both success paths and security violations
  - Include edge cases (special characters, large data, concurrent ops)
  - Verify tampering detection and error handling
  - Use timing-safe comparisons for security checks
- TypeScript Fixes: Use 'as any' sparingly for test mock compatibility

## 🏦 Bank Integration Patterns

### Dashboard Debugging Patterns
- **Systematic Data Flow Analysis**: Create comprehensive debugging scripts to analyze full data flow

- **Dynamic Tag References**: Extract tags from metadata outputs, not hardcoded SHAs
- **Health Endpoint Flexibility**: Skip database checks in test environments
- **Container Testing**: Always verify health checks pass before pushing
- **Next.js Standalone**: Must set ENV HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 for health checks to work (v1.3.0 fix)
- **Health Check Timing**: Let Dockerfile control timing, don't override in CI
- **ARM64 Optimization**: Conditional builds only for releases (75% faster CI/CD)

### GitHub Actions Best Practices
- **Lowercase Image Names**: Docker registry requires lowercase (subpilot-app not SubPilot-App)
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Use fromJSON() for accessing build metadata
- **Environment Variables**: Pass critical config to Docker containers
- **Job Dependencies**: Structure for maximum parallelization while maintaining safety

```

### TypeScript Build Configuration Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-05):
- Archive directories can cause TypeScript compilation failures in CI/CD
- Solution: Add archive directories to tsconfig.json exclude list
- Pattern: Exclude non-production code from TypeScript compilation
- Implementation: Added "archive" to exclude array in tsconfig.json
- Result: CI/CD pipeline builds successfully without attempting to compile debug code
```

### GitHub Release Creation Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-05):
- GitHub releases require different format than git annotated tags
- Git tags: Detailed technical information for developers
- GitHub releases: User-facing markdown with quick start, docker commands, highlights
- Solution: Use gh release create with proper markdown formatting
- Pattern: Create annotated tag for git history, then gh release for users
- Implementation: v1.8.0 release with standard sections matching previous releases
```

### Sentry v9 Migration Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-06):
- Sentry v8 to v9 requires API migration from class-based to functional approach
- Deprecated: new Replay() → Use: Sentry.replayIntegration()
- Next.js 15 requires instrumentation hooks instead of sentry.client.config.js
- Solution: Move client config to instrumentation-client.ts
- Pattern: Use functional integration API with Next.js instrumentation
- Implementation: Deleted sentry.client.config.js, updated imports and integrations
```

### Environment Variable Loading for ES Modules Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-06):
- ES module imports are hoisted before code execution
- Problem: env.js validation fails before dotenv can load .env.local
- Solution: Use dotenv-cli in npm scripts to preload environment
- Pattern: dotenv -e .env.local -- tsx script.ts
- Implementation: Updated test:production, validate:production, test:email scripts
- Result: Environment variables available before ES module evaluation
```

### SendGrid ES Module Import Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-06):
- @sendgrid/mail v8 exports default object, not namespace
- Error: sgMail.setApiKey is not a function with import * as sgMail
- Solution: Use default import - import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail'
- Pattern: Check module exports when migrating to ES modules
- Implementation: Fixed imports in sendgrid.ts and test scripts
```

### OAuth Authentication Configuration Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-07):
- NextAuth v5 uses different environment variable naming: AUTH_* instead of NEXTAUTH_*
- Problem: OAuth fails with "Missing required parameter: client_id" in production
- Solution: Support both v4 and v5 naming conventions with fallbacks
- Implementation: Created auth-v5-fix.config.ts with comprehensive fallback chain
- Pattern: Check env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID || process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID || process.env.AUTH_GOOGLE_ID
- Diagnostics: Created multiple endpoints in /api/auth/* for troubleshooting
- TypeScript: Fixed compilation errors with proper type annotations and async headers()
```

### NextAuth Provider Type Compatibility Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-07):
- NextAuth providers can be functions that return provider configs, not just objects
- Problem: TypeScript errors when mapping over authConfig.providers array
- Solution: Handle both provider objects and provider functions in type guards
- Pattern: const provider = typeof p === 'function' ? p() : p;
- Implementation: Fixed all OAuth diagnostic endpoints to handle dynamic providers
- Type Safety: Created proper interfaces for OAuth, Email, and other provider types
```

### Security Vulnerability Remediation Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-07):
- DOM XSS: Fixed innerHTML usage in archive/ui_fixes/debug-test.html
- Regex ReDoS: Tightened 3 overly permissive patterns in validation-schemas.ts
- Insecure Randomness: Replaced Math.random() with crypto.getRandomValues() in monthly-spending.ts
- Pattern: Apply security fixes even to archived/debug files
- Implementation: Systematic review and remediation of all security vulnerabilities
- Testing: Include dedicated security tests for vulnerability prevention
```

### Authentication Redirect Loop Fix Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-07):
- Edge Runtime Environment Variables: auth-edge.ts requires both AUTH_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_SECRET support
- Problem: Infinite redirect loop when authenticated users try to access protected routes
- Root Cause: Missing environment variable fallback in edge runtime context
- Solution: Support both NextAuth v4 (NEXTAUTH_SECRET) and v5 (AUTH_SECRET) naming
- Middleware Configuration: Properly exclude auth routes from protection with updated matcher
- Debug Strategy: Add comprehensive logging to middleware for auth flow troubleshooting
- Pattern: const secret = process.env.AUTH_SECRET || process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- Implementation: Updated auth-edge.ts and middleware.ts with fallback support and debug logging
- Testing: Created /api/auth/debug-session endpoint for authentication state inspection
```

### OAuth Authentication Debugging Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-07 20:16 EDT):
- URL Configuration Mismatch: OAuth callbacks fail when NEXTAUTH_URL doesn't match actual deployment URL
- Problem: Persistent redirect loops even after removing Vercel SSO protection
- Debug Infrastructure: Temporarily disable middleware auth checks for troubleshooting
- Comprehensive Logging: Add extensive debug logging to auth-edge.ts and middleware.ts
- Debug Endpoint: Create /api/auth/debug-redirect-loop for real-time diagnostics
- Environment Fix: Update AUTH_URL/NEXTAUTH_URL from production domain to Vercel app URL
- Middleware Exclusion: Ensure /api/auth paths are properly excluded from middleware processing
- Pattern: Always verify OAuth callback URLs match actual deployment URL
- Implementation: Debug-first approach with temporary auth bypass for investigation
```

### OAuth Account Linking UI Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-08):
- Multi-Provider Management: Complete OAuth account linking system for Google/GitHub providers
- tRPC Router Implementation: oauth-accounts.ts with full CRUD operations for account management
- React Component: ConnectedAccounts with real-time updates and toast notifications
- Auto-Linking: Enhanced auth callback for automatic account linking by email matching
- Security: Protection against removing last authentication method
- User Experience: Loading states, error handling, and success notifications
- Profile Integration: Seamless replacement of static OAuth section
- Pattern: Centralized OAuth management with type-safe API operations
- Implementation: v1.8.7 release with enterprise-grade authentication features
```

### Authentication Infrastructure Consolidation Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-08):
- Configuration Consolidation: 4 separate auth configs merged into auth.consolidated.ts
- Debug Cleanup: Removed 25+ debug/test endpoints while preserving production functionality
- Audit Logging: Maintained comprehensive security event tracking per user requirements
- Environment Compatibility: Support for both NextAuth v4/v5 environment variable naming
- TypeScript Excellence: Fixed all compilation errors during consolidation
- Backward Compatibility: Created smooth migration path with re-exports
- Pattern: Single source of truth for authentication configuration
- Implementation: Production-ready auth system with enterprise security features
```

### Git History Security Cleanup Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-08):
- Exposed Secret Incident: AUTH_SECRET accidentally committed in documentation file
- Tool Used: BFG Repo-Cleaner (Java-based Git history rewriter)
- Process Steps:
  1. Create repo-cleaning directory and add to .gitignore
  2. Download BFG: wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar
  3. Create secrets file with exposed secret value
  4. Clone mirror: git clone --mirror [repo-url]
  5. Run BFG: java -jar bfg.jar --replace-text secrets-to-remove.txt repo.git
  6. Clean refs: git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
  7. Force push: git push --force
  8. Update local: git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/main
- Secret Removed: EKZRPEVo3X/cZAgA6wam5L7ZwUeVfzPh5ivra0JiKQ4=
- Files Affected: docs/authentication-redirect-loop-fix.md (now deleted)
- Pattern: Always audit commits for secrets before pushing
```

### Admin Panel Implementation Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-08):
- MCP Tools Usage: Leverage zen__thinkdeep, sequential-thinking, context7 for comprehensive implementation
- Implementation Strategy: Analyze existing patterns → Plan with MCP tools → Execute systematically
- Admin Panel Sections Implemented:
  1. System Management: Feature flags, env vars, background jobs, cache
  2. Security Center: Audit logs, sessions, threats, 2FA settings
  3. Database Tools: Stats, performance, backups, migrations
  4. API Keys Manager: Service configs, rotation, usage stats
  5. Monitoring Dashboard: Real-time metrics, resources, performance
  6. Error Tracking: Logs, analytics, stack traces, resolution
- Technical Approach:
  - Created 6 new pages in /app/(dashboard)/admin/[section]/page.tsx
  - Extended adminRouter with 30+ new tRPC procedures
  - All endpoints protected with adminProcedure middleware
  - Consistent UI using existing shadcn/ui components
  - Mock data simulating real-world scenarios
- Pattern: Use MCP tools for rapid, comprehensive feature development
```
