- Bug fixes: `fix/description`
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Maintain good test coverage
- **TypeScript Compilation Excellence**: All mock data must match current Prisma schema, resolve UMD globals with proper imports, fix null assignments with type guards

**Next Focus**: Phase 4 (Launch & Marketing)
**Archive**: Historical phase details available in `/archive/phase-*-completion/`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Database First**: The Prisma schema is comprehensive and ready. Use it as the source of truth for data models.

2. **Type Safety**: Leverage tRPC and TypeScript for end-to-end type safety. The types should flow from database → API → frontend.

3. **Server Components**: Default to server components. Only use client components for interactivity.

4. **Security**: All sensitive data (Plaid tokens, etc.) must be encrypted. Never expose API keys in client code.

5. **Testing**: Write tests as you implement features. Don't leave testing until the end.

6. **Edge Runtime Compatibility**: Middleware runs in Edge Runtime. Use `auth-edge.ts` for auth checks instead of importing the full auth config. Complex security features (rate limiting, audit logging) must be in API routes, not middleware.

7. **Docker Health Checks**: Use DOCKER_HEALTH_CHECK_MODE=basic for test environments to skip database checks.

8. **ESLint v9 Migration**: Project uses flat config format with `eslint.config.js`. Install `@eslint/eslintrc` for compatibility with legacy extends. Remove old `.eslintrc.cjs` files. Migration completed 2025-07-04 01:52 EDT with working configuration.

9. **ESLint Error Fixing**: Use systematic six-agent approach to fix TypeScript type safety issues. NEVER remove features - implement proper types instead. Focus on unsafe any assignments, missing interfaces, and nullish coalescing adoption.

8. **CI/CD Best Practices**: Prefer single comprehensive workflows over multiple specialized ones for easier maintenance.


## 📞 External Services

- **Production Ready**: 99.5% test coverage, zero linting errors

## 🧪 Test Data Best Practices

When writing tests with TypeScript, define individual typed constants instead of using array access:

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid - TypeScript can't guarantee array element exists
const mockAccounts = [...];
const account = mockAccounts[0]; // Type: Account | undefined

// ✅ Preferred - TypeScript knows these constants exist
const mockAccount1: Account = {...};
const mockAccount2: Account = {...};
const mockAccounts: Account[] = [mockAccount1, mockAccount2];
const account = mockAccount1; // Type: Account (guaranteed)
```

This pattern eliminates the need for non-null assertions and improves test maintainability.

### TypeScript Compilation Excellence
- All mock data must match current Prisma schema
- Add missing imports (React, types) to resolve UMD globals
- Null assignment issues resolved with proper type guards
- Aggregate mock results align with expected Prisma types
- ESLint Config: Test files need rule overrides for flexible typing
- TypeScript Fixes: Use 'as any' sparingly for test mock compatibility

## 🔐 Security Testing Patterns

  - Session Management: 33 tests for fingerprinting and concurrent sessions
  - Rate Limiting: 23 tests for multi-tier limits with premium benefits
  - Audit Logging: 26 tests for security event tracking
- **Key Patterns**:
  - Test both success paths and security violations
  - Include edge cases (special characters, large data, concurrent ops)
  - Verify tampering detection and error handling
  - Use timing-safe comparisons for security checks
- TypeScript Fixes: Use 'as any' sparingly for test mock compatibility

## 🏦 Bank Integration Patterns

### Dashboard Debugging Patterns
- **Systematic Data Flow Analysis**: Create comprehensive debugging scripts to analyze full data flow
- **Sandbox Environment Limitations**: Plaid sandbox has no default transactions
- **Test Data Generation**: Generate test data population scripts for development environments
- **Multiple Worktrees**: Use different debugging approaches in parallel
- **Detection Thresholds**: Lower thresholds and widen windows for better results
- **Account ID Mapping**: Fix bugs that prevent data relationships
- **Pipeline Verification**: Always verify data at each step of the pipeline

### Plaid Integration Best Practices
- Use Plaid sandbox environment for safe development testing
- Create comprehensive mock data generators for testing without real accounts
- Implement proper webhook handling for real-time updates
- Store encrypted access tokens with proper key rotation
- Handle token refresh and re-authentication flows gracefully
- Test with multiple account types (checking, savings, credit)

### Subscription Detection Algorithms
- Analyze transaction patterns for merchant name consistency
- Implement amount tolerance (±5%) for variable subscriptions
- Use rolling window analysis (90 days) for pattern detection
- Calculate confidence scores based on multiple factors
- Handle edge cases (annual, quarterly, bi-weekly payments)
- Group related transactions by merchant for better accuracy

## 🎨 UI State Management

### Dashboard UI Patterns
- Implement skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
- Use optimistic updates for user actions
- Handle partial data loading gracefully
- Implement proper error boundaries for fault isolation
- Cache data appropriately with invalidation strategies
- Show meaningful empty states with actionable CTAs

### Theme System Implementation
- **next-themes Integration**: Seamless Light/Dark/Auto mode switching
- **Theme Consistency**: Applied across all pages including Profile and Settings
- **User Preference Persistence**: Theme choice saved in localStorage
- **System Preference Detection**: Auto mode respects OS theme settings
- **No Flash of Unstyled Content**: Proper theme initialization prevents FOUC

### Analytics UI Enhancements

- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Mocking**: External services properly mocked (Plaid, auth)
- **Status**: Test generation in progress for comprehensive coverage
- **Organization**: Tests organized by domain

## 🛠️ TypeScript Compilation Patterns

### Systematic Compilation Fixes
- **Prisma Schema Alignment**: Field name consistency across API routers
- **React 19 Compatibility**: JSX syntax requirements
- **Auth.js v5 Structure**: sessionToken not available client-side
- **Nullish Coalescing**: ??= and ?? preferred over || for assignments
- **JSON Field Access**: Type guards for database fields
- **Component Dependencies**: Install all required UI library components (@tanstack/react-table)
- **Edge Runtime**: Separate auth utilities for middleware compatibility
- **Middleware Restrictions**: No Node.js APIs, no dynamic imports, no Prisma client
- **ESLint Overrides**: Test files need flexible typing rules for mocking
- **Dynamic Imports**: Use @ts-ignore for .js extensions in TypeScript builds

## 🚀 CI/CD Patterns

### Workflow Consolidation
- **Single Comprehensive Workflow**: Consolidated ci.yml and docker-publish.yml into ci-cd-complete.yml
- **Eliminated Duplication**: One workflow handles all CI/CD operations
- **Improved Maintenance**: Easier to manage and update
- **Optimized Performance**: Reduced redundant builds and checks

### Docker Health Check Patterns
- **Test Environment Compatibility**: Use DOCKER_HEALTH_CHECK_MODE=basic for CI/CD
- **Dynamic Tag References**: Extract tags from metadata outputs, not hardcoded SHAs
- **Health Endpoint Flexibility**: Skip database checks in test environments
- **Container Testing**: Always verify health checks pass before pushing
- **Next.js Standalone**: Must set ENV HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 for health checks to work (v1.3.0 fix)
- **Health Check Timing**: Let Dockerfile control timing, don't override in CI
- **ARM64 Optimization**: Conditional builds only for releases (75% faster CI/CD)

### GitHub Actions Best Practices
- **Lowercase Image Names**: Docker registry requires lowercase (subpilot-app not SubPilot-App)
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Use fromJSON() for accessing build metadata
- **Environment Variables**: Pass critical config to Docker containers
- **Job Dependencies**: Structure for maximum parallelization while maintaining safety

## 🎯 SubPilot-Specific Development Patterns

### Import Alias Standardization Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-06-28):
- Mixed import aliases (@/ vs ~/) cause webpack module duplication
- Webpack treats different aliases as separate modules → TDZ errors
- Solution: Standardize ALL imports to single alias system
- Pattern: Check for mixed aliases when debugging build failures
- Implementation: SubPilot-App unified cancellation system
```

### Dynamic Import TypeScript Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-06-29):
- TypeScript can't resolve .js extensions in dynamic imports at build time
- Solution: Use @ts-ignore with explanatory comments
- Pattern: // @ts-ignore - seed files are TypeScript files that will be compiled to JS
- Implementation: SubPilot-App prisma/seed.ts CI/CD fix
```

### Three-Agent Cancellation Architecture
```
Proven Effective Pattern:
1. Primary Agent: Direct API integration approach
2. Secondary Agent: Event-driven background processing
3. Tertiary Agent: Lightweight manual fallback

Orchestration Service:
- Intelligent method selection based on capabilities
- Automatic fallback between methods
- Real-time progress updates
- Comprehensive type safety
- Clean separation of concerns
```

### Security Test Implementation Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-04):
- Comprehensive security tests essential for enterprise apps
- Use vi.hoisted() for proper mock initialization in Vitest
- Test categories: encryption, session management, rate limiting, audit logging
- Pattern: Test both success paths AND security violations
- Implementation: SubPilot-App v1.6.0 security test suite (126 tests)
```

### ESLint Configuration Migration Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-04):
- ESLint v9.0+ requires eslint.config.js instead of .eslintrc.* files
- Flat config format uses ES modules and @eslint/eslintrc compatibility
- Solution: Migrate to new format with proper Next.js plugin detection
- Pattern: Use FlatCompat for extending legacy configs in new format
- Installation: npm install @eslint/eslintrc --save-dev
- Next.js Detection: Create .eslintrc.json stub + eslint config in next.config.js
- Migration completed: 2025-07-04 01:52 EDT - ESLint functional with flat config
```

### Six-Agent ESLint Modernization Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-04):
- Six specialized agents working simultaneously for 50% ESLint error reduction
- Pattern: TypeScript Type Safety + Explicit Any Fixer + React JSX + Nullish Coalescing + Consistency + Cleanup
- Implementation: Each agent focuses on specific error categories to avoid conflicts
- Critical fixes: Boolean logic with nullish coalescing operators (|| vs ??)
- Results: ~1,200 errors → 577 errors (50% reduction) while preserving all functionality
- Memory tracking: Use MCP Memory server for persistent progress and pattern storage
```

### TypeScript Excellence & Final CI/CD Pipeline Restoration Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-04):
- Final TypeScript compilation fixes essential for unblocking CI/CD pipeline
- Pattern: Interface mismatches + Component prop types + Service layer alignment + Mock infrastructure
- Implementation: Enhanced cancellation type definitions, unified interfaces, proper type guards
- SubPilot-specific: Status-object pattern preservation throughout cancellation system
- Results: CI/CD pipeline operational, 85.6% test coverage stable, all orchestrator tests passing
- Critical fixes: API response validation conflicts, environment type safety, mock signature alignment
- Documentation workflow: Sync all three memory banks + comprehensive commit + GitHub push
- Phase transition: v1.6.1 complete - ready for Phase 4 launch activities
```

### Comprehensive Security Remediation Pattern
```
Critical Learning (2025-07-04):
- Enterprise security audit completed with 100% vulnerability remediation
- Pattern: Systematic security fixes without feature removal
- Implementation: Webhook verification, IDOR prevention, input validation
- Technologies: AES-256-GCM, HMAC signatures, comprehensive authorization
- Test Coverage: 123 dedicated security tests across all attack vectors
- Timeline: 6 hours vs 12 days estimated (83% faster with AI agents)
```
