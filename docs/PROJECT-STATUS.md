## 🔧 Previous Achievement: CI/CD Build Fix - Import Alias Standardization (June 28, 2025 - 08:22 AM EDT)

### Critical Build Error Resolved ✅
- ❌ **Problem**: "Cannot access before initialization" error during Next.js page data collection
- 🔍 **Root Cause**: Mixed import aliases (@/ vs ~/) causing webpack module duplication
- ✅ **Solution**: Standardized imports in `/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` to use ~/ consistently
- 🚀 **Result**: CI/CD pipeline restored, builds running successfully

### Technical Details
- Webpack was treating @/ and ~/ as different module namespaces
- This created duplicate module instances in the dependency graph
- Led to temporal dead zone (TDZ) errors during build-time analysis
- Debugged using MCP Intelligent Debugger combination (Zen + Sequential Thinking + Memory)
- Pattern recorded in Memory for future reference
