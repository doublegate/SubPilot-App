# API-First Subscription Cancellation System

## Overview

SubPilot's cancellation system is designed with an API-first approach that prioritizes official provider APIs, falls back gracefully to webhook-based confirmations, and provides comprehensive manual instructions when automated methods aren't available.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CancellationService** - Core business logic for processing cancellation requests
2. **Cancellation Router** - tRPC endpoints for type-safe API interactions
3. **Webhook Handler** - Receives cancellation confirmations from external providers
4. **UI Components** - Clean, user-friendly cancellation flow
5. **Provider Database** - Configurable cancellation methods for different services

### Database Models

- **CancellationProvider** - Configuration for each subscription service
- **CancellationRequest** - Tracks individual cancellation attempts
- **CancellationLog** - Detailed activity logging for transparency

## Cancellation Methods

### 1. API Integration (Primary)
- Direct API calls to provider cancellation endpoints
- OAuth or API key authentication
- Immediate confirmation when successful
- Automatic status updates

### 2. Webhook Confirmation (Secondary)
- For providers that support webhook notifications
- Initiate cancellation request, wait for confirmation
- Secure signature verification
- Real-time status updates

### 3. Manual Instructions (Fallback)
- Step-by-step instructions generated for user
- Contact information (phone, email, chat)
- Difficulty rating and time estimates
- User confirmation flow

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are available under the `cancellation` router:

### Initiate Cancellation
```typescript
api.cancellation.initiate.mutate({
  subscriptionId: "sub_123",
  priority: "normal", // low, normal, high
  notes: "Optional cancellation reason"
});
```

### Check Status
```typescript
api.cancellation.getStatus.query({
  requestId: "req_123"
});
```

### Confirm Manual Cancellation
```typescript
api.cancellation.confirmManual.mutate({
  requestId: "req_123",
  confirmation: {
    confirmationCode: "CANC123456",
    effectiveDate: new Date(),
    notes: "Called customer service",
    refundAmount: 15.99
  }
});
```

### Get History
```typescript
api.cancellation.getHistory.query({
  limit: 10
});
```

## Provider Configuration

Providers are configured in the database with:

```typescript
{
  name: "Netflix",
  normalizedName: "netflix",
  type: "api", // api, webhook, manual
  apiEndpoint: "https://api.netflix.com/cancel",
  authType: "oauth",
  difficulty: "easy", // easy, medium, hard
  successRate: 0.95,
  averageTime: 5, // minutes
  instructions: [...], // Step-by-step guide
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Webhook Integration

External providers can send cancellation confirmations to:
```
POST /api/webhooks/cancellation
Headers:
  x-provider-id: provider_id
  x-signature: hmac_signature (optional)

Body:
{
  provider: "netflix",
  confirmationCode: "CANC123456",
  status: "completed", // completed, failed, refunded
  effectiveDate: "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
  refundAmount: 15.99,
  metadata: { ... }
}
```

## UI Components

### CancelSubscriptionButton
- Embedded in subscription cards
- Checks cancellation eligibility
- Shows provider information and difficulty

### CancellationModal
- Initiates cancellation process
- Collects priority and notes
- Shows provider success rates

### CancellationStatus
- Real-time status tracking
- Activity log display
- Manual confirmation interface

### ManualInstructionsDialog
- Step-by-step cancellation guide
- Contact information links
- Confirmation form

## Usage Examples

### Basic Cancellation Flow
1. User clicks "Cancel Subscription" on subscription card
2. Modal shows provider info and difficulty rating
3. User confirms and selects priority
4. System determines best cancellation method
5. Real-time status updates provided
6. User receives confirmation when complete

### Manual Cancellation Flow
1. System generates personalized instructions
2. User follows step-by-step guide
3. User contacts provider using provided information
4. User confirms completion with optional details
5. Subscription marked as cancelled in system

## Security Features

- Webhook signature verification
- Rate limiting on cancellation attempts
- Audit logging for all cancellation activities
- User ownership verification
- Encrypted provider credentials

## Error Handling

- Automatic retry logic for failed API calls
- Graceful degradation to manual instructions
- Detailed error logging and user notifications
- Recovery options for stuck requests

## Monitoring & Analytics

- Success rates by provider
- Average cancellation times
- User completion rates for manual instructions
- Error patterns and failure analysis

## Future Enhancements

1. **Web Automation** - Browser automation for providers without APIs
2. **AI Assistant Integration** - Smart recommendations and guidance
3. **Bulk Cancellations** - Cancel multiple subscriptions at once
4. **Retention Offer Handling** - Negotiate better deals before cancelling
5. **Refund Tracking** - Monitor and track subscription refunds

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for core service logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock provider implementations
- Webhook validation testing

## Configuration

Environment variables required:
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For webhook signature verification
- Provider-specific API keys stored securely in database

## Getting Started

1. Seed cancellation providers:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/seed-cancellation-providers.ts
   ```

2. Test the cancellation flow in development:
   - Navigate to any active subscription
   - Click "Cancel Subscription"
   - Follow the guided process

3. Monitor cancellation requests in Prisma Studio:
   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```

The cancellation system is designed to be extensible, secure, and user-friendly while providing maximum automation where possible and clear guidance when manual intervention is required.
