## 🔧 Recent Technical Decisions & Workarounds

### Edge Runtime Middleware Refactoring (June 27, 2025 09:07 PM EDT)

**Issue**: Vercel Edge Runtime incompatibility with Node.js-specific modules
**Solution**: Refactored middleware to use only Web Standard APIs

**Features Moved to API Route Level**:
1. **Rate Limiting** - Moved from middleware to tRPC layer (requires Redis/in-memory state)
2. **Audit Logging** - Moved to individual API endpoints (requires database access)
3. **Complex Threat Detection** - Deferred to API-level implementation

**Security Features Preserved in Middleware**:
- ✅ CSRF validation (inline implementation)

### TypeScript Test Infrastructure (June 27, 2025)

**Unimplemented Router Methods** (Tests Commented Out):
1. `transactions.markAsSubscription` - Manual subscription marking
2. `transactions.detectSubscription` - AI-powered detection for single transactions

These test structures are preserved for future implementation.

### Security Implementation (June 27, 2025 10:45 PM EDT)

**Completed Security Features from security-integration-guide.md**:
1. **Account Lockout Protection** - Added to User model and auth flow
