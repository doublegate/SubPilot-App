## Development Setup

See our [Development Setup Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SubPilot-App.git
cd SubPilot-App

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# Set up database
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Avoid `any` types - use proper typing
- Export types separately from implementations
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React/Next.js

- Prefer server components by default
- Use client components only when necessary
- Follow React best practices and hooks rules
- Keep components small and focused

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the design system in `css_theme/`
- Use shadcn/ui components when available
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes

### API Design

- Use tRPC for all API endpoints
- Include proper input validation with Zod
- Handle errors gracefully
- Document complex logic with comments

### Testing

- Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Write E2E tests for critical user flows
- Aim for good test coverage

## Database Changes

When modifying the database schema:

1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run `npm run db:generate` to update the client
3. Run `npm run db:push` for development
4. For production changes, create a migration: `npm run db:migrate`
