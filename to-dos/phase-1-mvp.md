## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
1. **Plaid Credentials**
   - Impact: Cannot test bank integration
   - Resolution: Create Plaid developer account

2. **OAuth Production Credentials**
   - Impact: Using development placeholders
   - Resolution: Create production OAuth apps

### Risks
- **Risk**: Subscription detection accuracy
  - **Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate based on real data
- **Risk**: Performance with large transaction sets
  - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, caching, indexes
